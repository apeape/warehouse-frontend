Integrate the console stuff into a debug console tab inside the main client with a mutex for writing to make it thread safe so there are no longer two windows for the program all the time
Properly capitalise all the strings throughout the program
Get rid of all the magic numbers and replace them with appropriate centrally defined constants

In general: Add more error handling, in particular for the following fatal conditions:

	-lack of a PFX file
	-lack of the JSON RPC configuration file (or an empty/misconfigured one)
	
	In either of those cases the application should simply terminate after informing the user about the problem.
	Another possibility is simply disabling most buttons, preventing the user from clicking the controls which cannot work under those circumstances and offering, say, loading the certificate file and such from a file browse dialogue thingy which wil then copy it to the directory of the application.
